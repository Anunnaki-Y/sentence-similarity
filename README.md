# sentence-similarity

I plan to implement some models for sentence similarity found in the literature to reproduce and study them. They have a wide variety of application, including:

* **Paraphrase Detection**: Give two sentences, are the sentences paraphrases of each other?
* **Semantic Texual Similarity**: Given two sentences, how close are they in terms of semantic equivalence?
* **Natural Language Inference / Textual Entailment**: Can one sentence be inferred from another sentence (the premise)?
* **Answer Selection**: Given question-answer pairs, rank candidate answers based on relevance to question.

## Setup

Install packages in `requirements.txt`.

Download SpaCy English model:
```
python -m spacy download en
```

## Attribution

The English Wikipedia token frequency dataset for estimating p(w) in the baseline model is obtained from the official
SIF implementation: https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF.
